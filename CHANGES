Changes since version 1.0

- Broke module into individual class files. If you installed v1.0 of this 
module, you'll need to remove the RSS.pmod file that was installed before 
you can install subsequent versions.

- Better enforcement of RSS structure.

- Data generated for items is now more easily digested. Indescriminant use 
of arrays and mappings is minimized.
